git branch [new-branch] or checkout -b [new-branch]
Fast-forward merges occur when new commits have only occurred on the new branch. Recursive merges occur when commits have been made to both the new branch and the original
git checkout [switch-to-this-branch]
git checkout -d [delete-this-branch]
Merge conflicts occur when commits have been made to the same areas in both branches being merged.
